# SOLID Principles
## S -- Single Responsability Principle
- Classes should have only one responsability.
## O -- Open/Closed Principle
- Classes should be open for extension (being able to extend), but closed for modification.
- We can achieve this by private variables and just needed getter/setter.
## L -- Liskov Substitution Principle
- Parent classes could be replaced with any child class without altering correctness of the program.
## I -- Interface Segregation Principle
- Avoid fat interaces.
## D -- Dependency Inversion Principle
- Classes should depend on abstraction but not on concretion.
- Dependency injection is how objects obtain dependent objects.
- Abstraction should not depend upon details.
- Details should depend upon abstractions.
